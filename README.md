# MSc Research

My thesis is focused on simulating the differences between digital and analog aerial images to fascilitate a retrospective analysis of sediment within the lower Fraser River.

This is a repository where I will post some of the Matlab, R, Python, and IDL code that I have used throughout this research.

* Matlab - general image processing tasks
* Python - automating GIS workflows
* R - statistics
* IDL - automating object based image analysis in ENVI

Yes, you could do most everything in one language or another, but in general I like to embrace the strengths and weaknesses of each of these languages.
